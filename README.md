# Web Application Security Assessment  

This project focuses on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in a web application using penetration testing techniques. The goal is to analyze potential risks and suggest security improvements.  

## 🔍 Tools Used  
- **Burp Suite** – Intercepting HTTP traffic  
- **SQLMap** – Detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities  
- **Nmap** – Network scanning  
- **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability scanning  
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing environment  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- SQL Injection vulnerability discovered in login form  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) risk found in user input fields  
- Weak session management that could allow unauthorized access
